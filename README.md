# Ragel Cheat Sheet

[This repository](//github.com/jeremy-w/ragel-cheat-sheet) contains a cheat
sheet I wrote for myself back in 2010. I don't use Ragel often, but the several
times I've used it, this cheat sheet has helped me get back up to speed quite
quickly.

The cheat sheet provides a high-level survey of the Ragel system.
It won't replace the manual, but it will let you knowledgeably approach that as
a reference.

Since the contents of the cheat sheet were derived from the manual,
and the manual was GPLv2+-licensed, this document is as well.

Good luck!
